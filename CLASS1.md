## Intro

Today was day one into my coding journey and I can admit it was very overwhelming but at the same time very exciting! Learning this new skill is a challenge I am eager to face. Installing Homebrew via Ubuntu definitely gave me a run for my money as well as trying to memorize this entirely new coding language so I'm hoping to utilize this page to help me progress in my classes and help me reach my goals.

We started with the basics by going into The Terminal, which sounds ominous but is in fact a very basic and fundamental part of your computer to run command lines. By typing commands in The Terminal, you can do so much!

It's pretty exciting stuff :)
