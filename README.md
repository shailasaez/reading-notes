My reading journal for Code Fellows

When I think of Growth Mindset I boil it down to three words: Mind Over Matter. A growth mindset to me is having the ability to believe in yourself, the discipline to keep moving forward when face with an obstacle and the courage to ask for help when you need it the most.

To keep that growth mindset strong I have three little remidners to keep me going:
- Commitment. I have to be fully prepared to commit myself to every aspect in life.
- Failure. It's ok to fail and it should be embraced. It happens to EVERYONE. 
- Teamwork. No matter what you may think you don't have to do it alone.
