When I think of Growth Mindset I think of one of the most simple and amazing quotes I've ever heard:

> "You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take." - Wayne Gretzky 

A growth mindset to me is having the ability to believe in yourself, the discipline to keep moving forward when face with an obstacle and the courage to ask for help when you need it the most.

To keep that growth mindset strong I have three little remidners to keep me going:
- Commitment. I have to be fully prepared to commit myself to every aspect in life.
- Failure. It's ok to fail and it should be embraced. It happens to EVERYONE. 
- Teamwork. No matter what you may think you don't have to do it alone.

I keep all those things in mind when it comes to staying in that growth mindset. So believe in yourself and remember:
