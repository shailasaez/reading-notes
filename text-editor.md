# THE JOYS OF TEXT EDITOR

In every developerâ€™s journey, there comes a critical moment when she makes the most important decision a developer can make: what text editor to use. The text editor is a very important tool for a develope. Essentially a text editor is a piece of software that helps you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site.

## SO IT'S ***VERY IMPORTANT***!

Okay, maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration on the importance of a text editor but luckily you have options as to what you can use for a text editor. You can either use the text editor that comes with your computer. For Mac computers it's called **"Text Edit"** and on Windows it's called **"Notepad"**.

You also have the option of using a third-party like Notepad++ or Text Wrangler. I could list all of them but then we'd be here all day!
But let's not get too excited. This is just one of the tools we'll be using as a developer.

No two developers are the same so at the end of the day just find what works for you 


# HAPPY CODING!
